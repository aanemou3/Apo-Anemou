    <h1>My information</h1>
        <p class="new"> <strong>Hello, my Name is Apostolos Anemou and I am  from Greece/Thessaloniki. I am Computer Science student.<br>
      To be honest I do not have any experience in this field and I can say that I started working at an old age,<br>
      but the appetite for learning and development combined with the thirst I have will make me succeed.<br>
      I can say that from a young age I had some skills with technology and that made me adapt even easier, <br>
      but,life never brings them as you want, you have to fight for them. <br>
      I am playing football and I have done a lot of work in my life <br>
       and this has helped me to acquire some skills that will help me in the future.<br>
      For example: I am a team member ,I like organization and order, I have a perception <br>
       and I can make decisions quickly and in combination with the patience and perseverance <br>
      I have I can achieve whatever goal I have set in my mind. <br>
      I have passion and love for what I do, as a result of which I see work as something thankful <br> and through it I become even better and evolve into what I desire. <br>
      Finally, I would like to add that every person deserves an opportunity, <br>
       but beyond that it is up to him to seize it and become the best. <br>
      No one was born with experience!!!</strong>
